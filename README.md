# Discord Auto Message
A crude script letting users repeatedly send a message in a Discord channel, complete with variable random sleep times to appear more humanly.

## How to Use
1. Download the folder `discord_bot`
2. Open the Command Line and navigate to inside the folder.
3. Run the Python file. Type `python3 dbot.py` in the Command Line. All Macs should come with Python preinstalled, but Windows users might need to install it themselves.
4. Follows the instructions given on the script, and fill out the information necessary. Make sure it is 100% correct (especially the IDs, URLs, etc.) as even tiny mistakes will likely cause the bot to not work.

## Possible Questions
### Can Discord ban my account by noticing I am using this?
This is a question that I personally am not able to answer. After using this script for days, sending messages as frequent as every minute for as long as several hours, I have yet to see anything happen to my account, so I know that my account is safe, at least for now. Though there is a measure to avoid triggering bot detection, I cannot guarantee that Discord cannot detect a bot like this. **Use this script at your own risk**.
### Will this script steal my information?
This script does ask for your User Token. This provides authorization for it to send the message as **you**. You give your User Token to other websites quite frequently and you might not even notice it, like using those "Login With ServiceName" services. I will never slunk to such a low level and steal your information.

# Discord Auto Message
A crude script letting users repeatedly send a message in a Discord channel, complete with variable random sleep times to appear more humanly.

## How to Use
1. Download the code and unzip it.
2. Open the Command Line and navigate to inside the folder `discord_bot`.
3. Run the Python file. Type `python3 dbot.py` in the Command Line. `python3 dbot.py --help` will show all options availible.
5. Follows the instructions given on the script, and fill out the information necessary. Make sure it is 100% correct. The bot has a feature that stores necessary data in a file so you do not need to keep filling it out.

**Use at your own risk.**

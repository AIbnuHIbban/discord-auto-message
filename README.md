## How to Use
1. Download the code and unzip it.
2. Open the Command Line and navigate to inside the folder `discord_bot`.
3. Run the Python file. Type `python3 dbot.py` in the Command Line.
4. Follows the instructions given on the script, and fill out the information necessary. Make sure it is 100% correct. The bot has a feature that stores necessary data in a file so you do not need to keep filling it out.

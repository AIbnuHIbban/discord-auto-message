# Discord Auto Message
A crude script letting users repeatedly send a message in a Discord channel, complete with variable random sleep times to appear more humanly.

## How to Use
1. Download the code and unzip it.
2. Open the Command Line and navigate to inside the folder `discord_bot`.
3. Run the Python file. Type `python3 dbot.py` in the Command Line. All Macs should come with Python preinstalled, but Windows users might need to install it themselves.
4. Follows the instructions given on the script, and fill out the information necessary. Make sure it is 100% correct (especially the IDs, URLs, etc.) as even tiny mistakes will likely cause the bot to not work. The bot has a feature that stores necessary data in a file so you do not need to keep filling it out.

**Use at your own risk.**

# Discord Auto Message
**Notice: Though the script still works perfectly to date, I am not adding new features. Please fork the repo if you would like to add changes yourself.**

A crude script letting users repeatedly send a message in a Discord channel, complete with variable random sleep times to appear more humanly.

# Discord Auto Message
**Notice: The script works perfectly to date, and I will maintain it as needed. However, I am will not be implementing new features anymore. Please fork the repo if you would like to add changes yourself.**

A crude script letting users repeatedly send a message in a Discord channel, complete with variable random sleep times to appear more humanly. Makes use of Python's builtin `HTTP` module.
